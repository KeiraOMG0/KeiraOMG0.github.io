# Heads or Tails Coin Flip Simulation

This repository hosts a simple web application that simulates flipping a coin and calculates the number of attempts required to achieve a specified streak of heads or tails.

## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of this application hosted on GitHub Pages: [Heads or Tails Coin Flip Simulation](https://KeiraOMG0.github.io/)

## Features

- **Simulation**: Simulates flipping a coin until a specified streak of heads or tails is achieved.
- **Input**: Allows users to select heads or tails and specify the number of consecutive flips desired.
- **Output**: Displays the total number of attempts needed to achieve the specified streak.
- **Theoretical Odds**: Calculates the theoretical odds of achieving the specified streak based on coin flip probabilities.

## Usage

1. **Select Side and Enter Number of Consecutive Flips**:
   - Choose either "Heads" or "Tails" from the dropdown menu.
   - Input the desired number of consecutive flips (e.g., 8 for 8 heads or tails in a row).

2. **Start Simulation**:
   - Click the "Start Simulation" button to begin the coin flip simulation.

3. **View Results**:
   - The application will display the total number of attempts made to achieve the specified streak.
   - It will also show the theoretical odds of achieving this streak based on probability calculations.
